    <p>And I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner
        from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. Um ... but I'm
        excited to get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what
        you just talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these
        turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back
        into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing. And we are
        and, I don't know, winning?... Anyone? .... (long silence) .... Rhymes with
        winning? .... Anyone? .... Yeah, that would be us.  So if you think about
        it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse.
      <p>
        But it's just not ... I'm not fair game. I'm not a soft target. It's over.
        But there's also ... falling from it ... is the apple from The Giving Tree.
        There's my life. Deal with it. Oh, wait! Can't process it. Losers! WINNING!
        B'bye. It's being directed and written by a genius name David Ward who -
        oh, I don't know - won the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting. And
        it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today
        as Major League.  The goddesses? Alex, the goddesses .... Let me just say
        this about the goddesses: I don't believe the term is good enough ... is
        good enough ... but when you're bound by these terrestrial descriptions,
        you must use the best choice available, right? Um ... but I'm excited to
        get back ... to work. Um ... and not to completely discount what you just
        talked about ... It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ...
        these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the
        fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.

        And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle
        anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed
        in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.   And people say,
        'Oh, you know... you have to work through your resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm
        gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my attack. You know? Dealing
        with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my underwear before my
        first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns. I don't
        have time for their judgment and their stupidity and .... (sighs) But there
        are parts of me that is hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love,
        or you hate ... and you must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate
        violently is because ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your
        family, because they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at
        you in all forms and shapes.</p>
